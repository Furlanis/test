</div>

The city-state of Damatia is the strongest political kingdom on the Balkania continent, known for its prosperity and unique cultural foundations. Damatia's success comes from a strong work ethic and its magical technology: **Charotek**. In the words of the late King Arcturus:  
*"Yesh hauru dende orion, tek oida wun."*  
("No individual climbs the mountain of prosperity alone, only a company does so.")  

Damatians take pride in their shared vision and harshly punish criminals, with corruption being a social taboo. Notwithstanding its many benefits and opportunities, the Kingdom of Damatia harbors many secrets, with rumors of illicit and volatile Charotek experimentations abounding by the day on the busy streets and markets of the city-state.

# YOUR MISSIONS

## Damatia Knight Arc
The Royal Court seeks skilled knights with an experienced and active service to the Crown for this important mission: the retrieval of **Safira Crescentis**, the realm's ArchEngineer. Safira has neglected her duties, and her current whereabouts are unknown. Evidence points to a hidden sanctuary somewhere in the Damatian territory and a group of loyalists aiding her cause. The Crown demands her swift return.

---

## Desert Adept Arc
In the weeks following Safira's mysterious vanishing, Charotek devices—the very lifeblood of the nation—have begun to fail at critical junctures. Despite a swift and thorough investigation by the royal court, the cause remains elusive, with whispers of sabotage growing louder by the day. Bent on determining if a rogue agency is at play, Damatia has requested the expertise of a renowned Desert Adept from the Desert City. The adept is to join the inquiry, tasked with determining if a rogue practitioner of negation magic is at the root of these events.

---

## Forest Adept Arc
The Council of the Forest Castle was very worried. Their precious silver fox had been ill for a month. She can't eat, she sleeps all day, and the color of the crystals on her back has started to fade. It all started when a Damatian explorer visited their castle, and the council suspects he had something to do with the fox's condition. They sent their best researcher to Damatia to locate the explorer, examine the evidence, and obtain a cure for the fox.

---

## Stone Adept Arc
It was a typical, busy day at the Damatia Street market when, unexpectedly, a group of Borots burst onto the scene. They began throwing fruit, vegetables, and various objects from the stalls. Royal guards quickly arrived and managed to calm the Borots and escort them to their lair. After the incident, everything settled down, and everyone thought it was an isolated occurrence until it happened again. The Royal Court requested the Stone Adept's attention, certain that someone had tampered with the Borot's equipment. As an expert on Borot's behavior, he will be in charge of an investigative party to find a cause and a culprit for such strange occurrences.

## 🌟 **AVAILABLE CHARACTERS**  

### **STONE ADEPT** *(Fortitude/Intellect)*  
> - **Magic:** 🪨 *Stone Magic (Reinforcement)*  
> - **Traits:** 🛡️ Stoic • 💪 Resilient • 🌄 Awe-Inspiring  

## Background

Many things could be said about the Stone City Adepts, but one is certain: they are an honorable and respectful bunch. Surely, they are no ordinary folk. You cannot quite expect to have a leisurely talk with any of them, as they tend to be quite silent, stone-faced, and often peer into a single spot without moving. However, if you require a firm hand to rely on, they are your best bet—especially if they are currently in their “Exodus.”

During Exodus, you can count on some adventure, as they are ready to go forth and accomplish remarkable (and often dangerous) tasks. Most importantly, they won’t ask for a single piece of silver while doing so—strictly forbidden, you know? They must prove their mettle to pass the age of testing, a rite of passage of sorts. Some even speculate that Exodus is a nifty, almost devious way to curb their population numbers, ensuring only the strong remain. This aligns perfectly with their attitude.

---
###  **DESERT ADEPT** *(Presence/Agility)*  
> - **Magic:** 🌀 *Desert Magic (Negation)*  
> - **Traits:**  🕶️ Mysterious • 👻 Eerie • 🌪️ Feared  

## Background

One simply does not go into the Desert City uninvited. This is what is often said about the submerged city. Truly, the Alia—as the Desert dwellers call their city area—is a place where seldom a traveler ventures freely. The cause for such weariness lies not only in the precarious desert pocket, home to many poisonous insects and quicksand sinks, but even more in the **nullity**, a field of negation magic that permeates the air, earth, and sky around the Charocracy Desert.

Here, the closer one gets to the city’s underground entrance, the harder it becomes to manifest any form of magic. Moreover, the more powerful and sensitive a magical user is, the greater discomfort they will suffer. For this reason, approved guests are always escorted by Desert Adepts—**A’limon**—who alone are capable of controlling the flow of nullity in their vicinity, thus securing the safety of their invited guests.

---
###  **FOREST ADEPT** *(Presence/Empathy)*  
> - **Magic:** 🌸 *Forest Magic (Life)*  
> - **Traits:** 🦋 Lively • 🌿 Symbiotic • 🔄 Ever-Changing  

## Background

Experienced adventurers will often advise their younger kin not to judge the “Foresters” based on first impressions. It can often happen that one shares travel with a brooding, silent forest mage, only to find the same person, years later, thoroughly changed in appearance and personality. Due to these vigorous changes in character, friendships with Forest dwellers are intense but seldom last long in the same form or manner.

This permutability is also reflected in the life of the city, where personal relations are constantly formed and reformed as its dwellers frequently move from one part of the city to another, engaging in different roles and tasks in the process. Interestingly, these social and personal changes produce no discomfort for the city’s inhabitants. Instead, they are accepted as a force of vitality and joy—an opportunity for a clean, fresh start and loads of happiness on the road.

###  **KIGOI MUSICIAN** *(Eloquence/Intuition)*  
> - **Magic:** ✨ *Conduit to All Magic*  
> - **Traits:** 🎭 Artistic • 🎻 Sensitive • 🌈 Aesthetic

## Background

“You know, I have to bust your Damatian dream here, because not everyone is so jolly about Damatia as you seem to be! You’ve heard about the Kigoi, right? Those pointy-eared nomads with fair skin and elegant faces? Well, if you find one that’s talkative, you’ll hear firsthand how much the ‘freedom-loving’ Damatian Law really is. People disappearing in the night, many of them Kigoi! And then? A couple of months later, a series of newly upgraded Charomons rolls out on the streets. Peculiar, ain’t it? And what of the forbidden experiments in underground laboratories? And the obvious change that comes with the imprint? Don’t you dare speak to me about conspiracy theories! Parts of my family, my own kin, became outright placid after it! Nonsense, you say? Take me for a fool, but you won’t make an imprint out of me, that’s for sure!”  
— *Jerry the Rogue, Convicted Damatian Criminal*

---
### **DAMATIA KNIGHT** *(Might/Eloquence)*  
> - **Role:** 🛡️ *Protector of Damatia*  
> - **Traits:** 🏛️ Disciplined • 💬 Inspiring • ⚡ Loyal

## Background

Damatians see their city-state as the jewel of the continent and accknowledge their common heritage with great pride. For this reason, they do not accept lightly when someone blemishes this commonly shared vision. Consequently, criminals are harshly punished, and even smaller transgressions such as cheating in trade is strongly penalized. Corruption is a social taboo, and physically hurting a fellow Damatian is met with harsh retribution. Damatia takes good care of its citizens, often providing many of the necessary social services such as education medical aid and public safety without any cost to its citizens. Citizens contribute to this common welfare with the “imprint” – the provision of one’s mental state, one’s memories, emotions and character for the creation of Charotek automatons or "Borots" as the common folk calls them.

## Party Meeting Place: The Royal Hall

The Royal Hall of Damatia hums with ever-constant anticipation as sunlight streams through the mosaic-glass windows, casting vibrant patterns across its polished floor. **Borots** and humans alike stride toward their tasks, immersed in the subtle hum and whirring of the grand clockwork mechanism. The air is thick with the scent of polished metal, expensive perfumes, and beeswax—a fitting aroma for this place of power, where the Kingdom shapes its destiny.

**LONG GAMEPLAY GUIDE**

**PARTY PHASE**

Reveal your characters
Introduce your character to the party! 
Introduce your intentions and interpretations of occuring events!
Who is Safira for you? Why did she escape? What do you think she wants to do?
Reveal your interpretation of occuring events, and state your character's agenda (or keep them hidden!)

---
**ADVENTURE PHASE:**

1.  **Place four encounter cards in a row:** ➤ This is your turn.
2.  **The 1st player reveals the first card (from the right):** ➤ This player is the STORYTELLER for this encounter!
3.  **The STORYTELLER narrates the encounter:** ➤ Unleash your STORYTELLER imagination!
4.  **STORYTELLER rolls DC for this encounter (STORYTELLER):** ➤ STORYTELLER roll 1d20 to set the EDC (Encounter Dice Check).
5.  **Set EDC Range:** ➤ The Encounter Dice Check Range formula: [STORYTELLER roll-1, STORYTELLER roll, STORYTELLER roll+1].
    *   Example: STORYTELLER rolls 14. EDC: 13, 14, 15.
    *   Example 2: STORYTELLER rolls 20. EDC: 19, 20, 21.
6.  **After the EDC is determined, the next player narrates how their character interacts with this encounter:** ➤ Unleash your player imagination!
      Once narration is finished, that player immediately rolls their 1d20 dice to see if their character resolves the encounter by succesfully accomplishing their intention ➤ Player roll 1d20.
8.  **Check Bonuses:** ➤ Apply your ability modifiers or your encounter bonuses.
    *   If any of the abilities on the character card match an ability on the encounter card, that character can manipulate the result of their roll by 1 (either adding or subtracting 1 from their rolled value).
    *   If you have won an encounter card in a previous turn, you may use (exhaust, consume) the effect on that encounter card to adjust your roll value. If you do it, exhaust this encounter card (flip it face down).
    *   Players can only use one encounter card per player per turn. (I.e. in a party of 3, three players can use their encounters to boost a single player's roll, for that single encounter).
9.  **Resolve the encounter:** ➤ If the character manages to resolve the EDC, that character has won the encounter and that character concludes the story for that encounter. If no character in the party manages to resolve the EDC, Safira receives that card (move the card to her Hideout) and the last player to play (the STORYTELLER), concludes the story accordingly.
    **In case of TIE:** (i.e., two or more characters have also managed to resolve the EDC), those players need to roll again simultaneously, and whoever receives a greater number wins. 
10.  **Repeat steps 6-9** with all other players except the STORYTELLER. Then, finally, the player that was the STORYTELLER for this encounter plays the encounter as their character (by repeating steps 6 and 7 as all other players).

11. **When encountering a Safira Loyalist**, if no character in the party wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, the Loyalist moves to Safira's hideout. (I.e. Safira won her Loyalist).
    If the loyalist moves to Safira's hideout: Raise the DC for all upcoming adventure phase encounters with a +1.
    If a player wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, that player receives the Loyalist card. (I.e. The loyalist joins that character and the party).
