The city-state of Damatia is the strongest political kingdom on the Balkania continent, known for its prosperity and unique cultural foundations. Damatia's success comes from a strong work ethic and its magical technology: Charotek. In the words of the late King Arcturus: *"Yesh hauru dende orion, tek oida wun."* ("No individual climbs the mountain (of prosperity) alone, only a company does so.) Damatians take pride in their shared vision and harshly punish criminals, with corruption being a social taboo. Citizens contribute to the common welfare through the "imprint" - providing their mental state to create Charotek automatons that the people simply call "Borots". Notwithstanding its many benefits and opportunities, the Kingdom of Damatia harbors many secrets, with rumors of illicit and volatile Charotek experimentations abounding by the day on the busy streets and markets of the city state.

**YOUR MISSIONS:**

DAMATIA KNIGHT ARC:

The Royal Court seeks skilled adventurers for a mission: the retrieval of Safira Crescentis, the realm's ArchEngineer. Safira has relegated on her duties, and her current whereabouts are unknown. Evidence points to a hidden sanctuary somewhere in the Damatian territory and a group of loyalists aiding her cause. The Crown demands her swift return and promises great rewards.
---
DESERT ADEPT ARC:

In the weeks following Safira's mysterious vanishing, Charotek devices—the very lifeblood of the nation—have begun to fail at critical junctures. Despite a swift and thorough investigation by the royal court, the cause remains elusive, with whispers of sabotage growing louder by the day. Bent to determine if rogue agency is at play, Damatia has requested the expertise of a renowned desert adept from the Desert City. The adept is to join the inquiry, tasked with determining if a rogue practitioner of negation magic is at the root of these events.
---
FOREST ADEPT ARC:

The Council of the Forest Castle was very worried. Their precious silver fox had been ill for a month. She can't eat, she sleeps all day, and the color of the crystals on her back has started to fade. It all started when the Damatian explorer visited their castle, and the council suspects he had something to do with the fox's condition. They sent their best researcher to Damatia to locate the explorer, examine the evidence, and obtain a cure for the fox.

## 🌟 **AVAILABLE CHARACTERS**  

### **STONE ADEPT** *(Fortitude/Intellect)*  
> - **Magic:** 🪨 *Stone Magic (Reinforcement)*  
> - **Traits:** 🛡️ Stoic • 💪 Resilient • 🌄 Awe-Inspiring  

# Stone Adept Background

Many things could be said about the Stone City Adepts, but one is certain: they are an honorable and respectful bunch. Surely, they are no ordinary folk. You cannot quite expect to have a leisurely talk with any of them, as they tend to be quite silent, stone-faced, and often peer into a single spot without moving. However, if you require a firm hand to rely on, they are your best bet—especially if they are currently in **“Exodus.”**

During Exodus, you can count on some adventure, as they are ready to go forth and accomplish remarkable (and often dangerous) tasks. Most importantly, they won’t ask for a single piece of silver while doing so—strictly forbidden, you know? They must prove their mettle to pass the age of testing, a rite of passage of sorts. Some even speculate that Exodus is a nifty, almost devious way to curb their population numbers, ensuring only the strong remain. This aligns perfectly with their attitude.

###  **DESERT ADEPT** *(Presence/Agility)*  
> - **Magic:** 🌀 *Desert Magic (Negation)*  
> - **Traits:**  🕶️ Mysterious • 👻 Eerie • 🌪️ Feared  

# Desert City Background

One simply does not go into the Desert City uninvited. This is what is often said about the submerged city. Truly, the Alia—as the Desert dwellers call their city area—is a place where seldom a traveler ventures freely. The cause for such weariness lies not only in the precarious desert pocket, home to many poisonous insects and quicksand sinks, but even more in the **nullity**, a field of negation magic that permeates the air, earth, and sky around the Charocracy Desert.

Here, the closer one gets to the city’s underground entrance, the harder it becomes to manifest any form of magic. Moreover, the more powerful and sensitive a magical user is, the greater discomfort they will suffer. For this reason, approved guests are always escorted by Desert Adepts—**A’limon**—who alone are capable of controlling the flow of nullity in their vicinity, thus securing the safety of their invited guests.

###  **FOREST ADEPT** *(Presence/Empathy)*  
> - **Magic:** 🌸 *Forest Magic (Life)*  
> - **Traits:** 🦋 Lively • 🌿 Symbiotic • 🔄 Ever-Changing  

# Forest City Background

Experienced adventurers will often advise their younger kin not to judge the “Foresters” based on first impressions. It can often happen that one shares travel with a brooding, silent forest mage, only to find the same person, years later, thoroughly changed in appearance and personality. Due to these vigorous changes in character, friendships with Forest dwellers are intense but seldom last long in the same form or manner.

This permutability is also reflected in the life of the city, where personal relations are constantly formed and reformed as its dwellers frequently move from one part of the city to another, engaging in different roles and tasks in the process. Interestingly, these social and personal changes produce no discomfort for the city’s inhabitants. Instead, they are accepted as a force of vitality and joy—an opportunity for a clean, fresh start and loads of happiness on the road.

# Kigoi Musician Background

“You know, I have to bust your Damatian dream here, because not everyone is so jolly about Damatia as you seem to be! You’ve heard about the Kigoi, right? Those pointy-eared nomads with fair skin and elegant faces? Well, if you find one that’s talkative, you’ll hear firsthand how much the ‘freedom-loving’ Damatian Law really is. People disappearing in the night, many of them Kigoi! And then? A couple of months later, a series of newly upgraded Charomons rolls out on the streets. Peculiar, ain’t it? And what of the forbidden experiments in underground laboratories? And the obvious change that comes with the imprint? Don’t you dare speak to me about conspiracy theories! Parts of my family, my own kin, became outright placid after it! Nonsense, you say? Take me for a fool, but you won’t make an imprint out of me, that’s for sure!”

**PARTY PHASE**

Reveal your characters
Introduce your character to the party! 
Introduce your intentions and interpretations of occuring events!
Who is Safira for you? Why did she escape? What do you think she wants to do?
Reveal your interpretation of occuring events, and state your character's agenda (or keep them hidden!)

---
**ADVENTURE PHASE:**

1.  **Place four encounter cards in a row:** ➤ This is your turn.
2.  **The 1st player reveals the first card (from the right):** ➤ This player is the STORYTELLER for this encounter!
3.  **The STORYTELLER narrates the encounter:** ➤ Unleash your STORYTELLER imagination!
4.  **STORYTELLER rolls DC for this encounter (STORYTELLER):** ➤ STORYTELLER roll 1d20 to set the EDC (Encounter Dice Check).
5.  **Set EDC Range:** ➤ The Encounter Dice Check Range formula: [STORYTELLER roll-1, STORYTELLER roll, STORYTELLER roll+1].
    *   Example: STORYTELLER rolls 14. EDC: 13, 14, 15.
    *   Example 2: STORYTELLER rolls 20. EDC: 19, 20, 21.
6.  **After the EDC is determined, the next player narrates how their character interacts with this encounter:** ➤ Unleash your player imagination!
      Once narration is finished, that player immediately rolls their 1d20 dice to see if their character resolves the encounter by succesfully accomplishing their intention ➤ Player roll 1d20.
8.  **Check Bonuses:** ➤ Apply your ability modifiers or your encounter bonuses.
    *   If any of the abilities on the character card match an ability on the encounter card, that character can manipulate the result of their roll by 1 (either adding or subtracting 1 from their rolled value).
    *   If you have won an encounter card in a previous turn, you may use (exhaust, consume) the effect on that encounter card to adjust your roll value. If you do it, exhaust this encounter card (flip it face down).
    *   Players can only use one encounter card per player per turn. (I.e. in a party of 3, three players can use their encounters to boost a single player's roll, for that single encounter).
9.  **Resolve the encounter:** ➤ If the character manages to resolve the EDC, that character has won the encounter and that character concludes the story for that encounter. If no character in the party manages to resolve the EDC, Safira receives that card (move the card to her Hideout) and the last player to play (the STORYTELLER), concludes the story accordingly.
    **In case of TIE:** (i.e., two or more characters have also managed to resolve the EDC), those players need to roll again simultaneously, and whoever receives a greater number wins. 
10.  **Repeat steps 6-9** with all other players except the STORYTELLER. Then, finally, the player that was the STORYTELLER for this encounter plays the encounter as their character (by repeating steps 6 and 7 as all other players).

11. **When encountering a Safira Loyalist**, if no character in the party wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, the Loyalist moves to Safira's hideout. (I.e. Safira won her Loyalist).
    If the loyalist moves to Safira's hideout: Raise the DC for all upcoming adventure phase encounters with a +1.
    If a player wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, that player receives the Loyalist card. (I.e. The loyalist joins that character and the party).

**SAFIRA'S PHASE:**

**Setup:** 
Shuffle Safira's encounter cards (encounters Safira won through the game). 
Arrange them face up in rows of four, from right to left. This usually creates columns of varying heights with highest columns being on the right.

**Challenge Order:** 
Safira's encounters are challenged from right to left, column by column. There can be up to four columns.

**Resolution order:**
Each column is treated as a single, combined encounter.
The STORYTELLER opens all cards in a column, narrates the story connecting these encounters and rolls a single d20 to determine the Encounter Difficulty Check (EDC) for this entire column 
(i.e. all encounters in that column will now have the same EDC)

**Players will attempt to resolve individual cards within the current column**

A)Start from the bottom encounter. 

B)All players roll their DC roll. 
  -Apply Card Bonuses and Ability bonuses-
  
C)Player(s) who resolved the encounter conclude the narration, the encounter remains face up. 
ELSE
If all players failed to resolve the encounter, they can freely narrate their failures. The encounter is flipped face down. 

D)Players move to the next encounter upward. 

E)When all encounters in a story column have been engaged, the next player in the party opens the next story column to the left and narrates it. 
REPEAT Story Column Resolutions. 

Every player must act as the "Dungeon Master" (STORYTELLER) for at least one full column of encounters.
