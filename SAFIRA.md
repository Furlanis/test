# Balkanika: Safira’s Escape

*Where every turn is a different story!*

*A cooperative adventure card game*

*For 2-5 players • Ages 7+ • 90-180 minutes*

**Tired of pre-written narratives? In this unique game, you and your party are the storytellers. 
Every playthrough is a brand-new adventure, born from your collective imagination and driven by your choices.**

**The Dance of Storytellers**
This game is not about winning or losing! 
Rather, who will manage to be the conclusive storyteller? 
Will it be your party of characters or will it be Safira?
The answers aren't pre-written; they emerge organically as you narrate through the encounters. 

**The size of your group influences the narrative balance.** 
Smaller parties offer Safira a greater opportunity to shape events according to her will. 
Larger parties have more influence over the unfolding story.
Consider these power relations when forming your adventuring group! 

**Dynamic Encounters, Player-Driven Outcomes:** 
Every encounter builds the world around you. 
Safira's very nature changes based on the story you create. 
Her personality, her goals, her role in the world.
Will she become a heroic ally or a formidable foe? A trusted friend or a cunning adversary?
And how will your characters interact with her, and with each other? 
You decide!

**A Continuously Evolving Narrative:**
The story doesn't end with a single victory or defeat. 
After facing Safira in her hideout, each player concludes their character's personal story arc. 
Did you successfully thwart Safira's plans and achieve your own ambitions? 
If so, carry a fraStorytellerent of your triumph into a fresh adventure. 
And if Safira manages to evade your grasp and realize her own intentions, a new chapter begins, offering fresh challenges and possibilities.

**Key Features:**
**Generative Storytelling:** No two games are ever the same. (Like really, it's not possible!)

**You are the STORYTELLER:** Your choices shape the narrative and Safira herself. (You tell the story as you see fit!)

**Collaborative Experience:** Work with your party to craft a unique and unforgettable story. (Individual stories chain!)

**High Replay Value:** Start fresh adventures with the same or new characters. (If you want!)

**GEOGRAPHY:**
The city-state of Damatia is the strongest political kingdom on the Balkania continent, known for its prosperity and unique cultural foundations. Damatia’s success comes from a strong work ethic and the uniqueness of its magical technology: Charotek. In the words of the late King Arcturus: *"Yesh hauru dende orion, tek oida wun."* ("No individual climbs the mountain (of prosperity) alone, only a company does so (properly).") To achieve this, citizens are encouraged to devote themselves to three pillars of Damatian stability: innovation, economy, or military. Damatians take pride in their shared vision and harshly punish criminals, with corruption being a social taboo. Citizens contribute to the common welfare through the "imprint" - providing their mental state to create Charotek automatons called “Charomons,” or as the people simply call them: "Borots". Notwithstanding its many benefits and opportunities, the Kingdom of Damatia harbors many secrets, with rumors of illicit and volatile Charotek experimentations abounding by the day on the busy streets and markets of the city state.

**YOUR MISSION:**
The Royal Court seeks skilled adventurers for a mission: the retrieval of Safira Crescentis, the realm's ArchEngineer. Safira has relegated on her duties, and her current whereabouts and intentions are unknown. Available evidence points to a hidden sanctuary somewhere in the Damatian territory and a group of loyalists aiding her cause. The Crown demands her swift return and promises great rewards to those who fulfill the mission.

4.  Players narrate and roll to resolve the encounter.
    (Check any character abilities and encounter bonuses to apply them!)
5.  Resolve encounter.
6.  If no player resolves the encounter, move it to Safira’s hideout.
7.  Repeat!
7.a. If you do not resolve a Safira loyalist encounter, move the loyalist to Safira's hideout and raise the DC +1 for all upcoming encounters. 
     If a player resolves a Safira loyalist encounter, she keeps that loyalist as per usual encounter mechanic.
     (i.e. the loyalist joins the party, to aid that character).
9.  Encounter Safira: After round 6 or if you narrate through all the encounter cards.
10.  Safira's hideout:

        Safira's encounters are shuffled and placed, row above row, of four cards, from right to left, bottom up.
        Safira's encounters are challenged from right to left, column by column (max 4 columns, and X rows).
        Each encounter column is opened as a single encounter, by the STORYTELLER who rolls a single DC for that entire column.
        Players try to resolve individual encounters in that column, as per usual mechanic (EDC).
        To resolve an encounter column, players need to resolve all encounters in that column.

**LONG GAMEPLAY GUIDE**

**PARTY PHASE**
Reveal your characters
Each character answers: Who is Safira for you? Why did she escape? What do you think she wants to do? 

**ADVENTURE PHASE:**

1.  **Place four encounter cards in a row:** ➤ This is your turn.
2.  **The 1st player reveals the first card (from the right):** ➤ This player is the STORYTELLER for this encounter!
3.  **The STORYTELLER narrates the encounter:** ➤ Unleash your STORYTELLER imagination!
4.  **STORYTELLER rolls DC for this encounter (STORYTELLER):** ➤ STORYTELLER roll 1d20 to set the EDC (Encounter Dice Check).
5.  **Set EDC Range:** ➤ The Encounter Dice Check Range formula: [STORYTELLER roll-1, STORYTELLER roll, STORYTELLER roll+1].
    *   Example: STORYTELLER rolls 14. EDC: 13, 14, 15.
    *   Example 2: STORYTELLER rolls 20. EDC: 19, 20, 21.
6.  **After the EDC is determined, the next player narrates how their character interacts with this encounter:** ➤ Unleash your player imagination!
      Once narration is finished, that player immediately rolls their 1d20 dice to see if their character resolves the encounter by succesfully accomplishing their intention ➤ Player roll 1d20.
8.  **Check Bonuses:** ➤ Apply your ability modifiers or your encounter bonuses.
    *   If any of the abilities on the character card match an ability on the encounter card, that character can manipulate the result of their roll by 1 (either adding or subtracting 1 from their rolled value).
    *   If you have won an encounter card in a previous turn, you may use (exhaust, consume) the effect on that encounter card to adjust your roll value. If you do it, exhaust this encounter card (flip it face down).
    *   Players can only use one encounter card per player per turn. (I.e. in a party of 3, three players can use their encounters to boost a single player's roll, for that single encounter).
9.  **Resolve the encounter:** ➤ If the character manages to resolve the EDC, that character has won the encounter and that character concludes the story for that encounter. If no character in the party manages to resolve the EDC, Safira receives that card (move the card to her Hideout) and the last player to play (the STORYTELLER), concludes the story accordingly.
    **In case of TIE:** (i.e., two or more characters have also managed to resolve the EDC), those players need to roll again simultaneously, and whoever receives a greater number wins. 
10.  **Repeat steps 6-9** with all other players except the STORYTELLER. Then, finally, the player that was the STORYTELLER for this encounter plays the encounter as their character (by repeating steps 6 and 7 as all other players).

11. **When encountering a Safira Loyalist**, if no character in the party wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, the Loyalist moves to Safira's hideout. (I.e. Safira won her Loyalist).
    If the loyalist moves to Safira's hideout: Raise the DC for all upcoming adventure phase encounters with a +1.
    If a player wins the Safira Loyalist encounter, that player receives the Loyalist card. (I.e. The loyalist joins that character and the party). 
    
**SAFIRA'S PHASE:**

**Setup:** 
Shuffle Safira's encounter cards (encounters Safira won through the game). 
Arrange them face up in rows of four, from right to left. This usually creates columns of varying heights with highest columns being on the right.

**Challenge Order:** 
Safira's encounters are challenged from right to left, column by column. There can be up to four columns.

**Resolution order:**
Each column is treated as a single, combined encounter.
The STORYTELLER opens all cards in a column, narrates the story connecting these encounters and rolls a single d20 to determine the Encounter Difficulty Check (EDC) for this entire column 
(i.e. all encounters in that column will now have the same EDC)

**Players will attempt to resolve individual cards within the current column using the standard game mechanics**

A)The next player in turn order chooses what encounter to engage 
B) Narrates their actions
C) Rolls 1d20, applies bonuses, and checks against the EDC range.
        (As usual other players may assist with their bonuses)
D)If the encounter is resolved it is fliced face down, if it is not, it remains face up. 
E)Players take turns facing encounters within the same column. Each player attempts one encounter. If successful, the encounter is resolved (flipped face down). If all players fail an encounter in a column, or if all encounters in a column are resolved, the party advances to the next column to the left. Every player must act as the "Dungeon Master" (STORYTELLER) for at least one full column of encounters.
