Every encounter builds the world you engage.
Safira's very nature changes based on the story you create. Her personality, her goals, her role in the world—it's all in your hands.
Will she be a hero or a villain? A friend or foe? 
And how will your character and your party relate to her? 
You decide as your choices determine the outcome of each encounter, narrated from either your perspective or Safira's.

After facing all of Safira's challenges, each player concludes their character's personal story arc.

*Unique game approach: The essence of this game is generative, unconstrained, storytelling. All game resources are here at your disposal to enable you, as the individual player, and your collective party to tell your own story. What will this adventure of yours be all about? Who are your characters and what are their intentions? Who is Safira actually and what is the secret behind her escape? These questions are set in the beginning of your play, and unroll, unravel and unfold as you play according to your own narrative choices! Finally, when you encounter Safira in her hideout, who and what will she be? It depends on the story you have constructed as a party until this moment. Is she a hero or a villain? A traitor or a ... Is she mean or gentle? Mysterious or Bland? With these story constructs you will engage Safira's encounters in trying to resolve them succesfully and finish the story as your character sees fit. And if you fail to resolve the encounters, you will narrate how Safira managed to best your intentions with her and accomplish her own! Thus, with each encounter you engage you will construct the ending of a story chapter either from your own or Safira's character perspective. Finally, once all of Safira's encounters have been engaged, each player will conclude their own character's story arc. And dependent on your story's conclusion, you may start a new, fresh, adventure. If the party managed to best Safira's intentions, and realize their own, then each player may keep a single encounter card and start the game anew! But if Safira managed to realize her own intentions then the party starts a new game without any kept encounters. 

*Difficulty note: The game is optimally played with 3 and 4 players in a party. 2 players will have the most difficult time to shape the final story according to their party's intentions rather than Safira's , while a party of 5 will have the greatest capacity to shape Safira's destiny. Keep this in mind when deciding your optimal story telling adventure!

**GEOGRAPHY:**
The city-state of Damatia is the strongest political kingdom on the Balkania continent, known for its prosperity and unique cultural foundations. Damatia’s success comes from a strong work ethic and the uniqueness of its magical technology: Charotek. In the words of the late King Arcturus: *"Yesh hauru dende orion, tek oida wun."* ("No individual climbs the mountain (of prosperity) alone, only a company does so (properly).") To achieve this, citizens are encouraged to devote themselves to three pillars of Damatian stability: innovation, economy, or military. Damatians take pride in their shared vision and harshly punish criminals, with corruption being a social taboo. Citizens contribute to the common welfare through the "imprint" - providing their mental state to create Charotek automatons called “Charomons,” or as the people simply call them: "Borots". Notwithstanding its many benefits and opportunities, the Kingdom of Damatia harbors many secrets, with rumors of illicit and volatile Charotek experimentations abounding by the day on the busy streets and markets of the city state.

**YOUR MISSION:**

The Royal Court seeks skilled adventurers for a mission: the retrieval of Safira Crescentis, the realm's ArchEngineer. Safira has relegated on her duties, and her current whereabouts and intentions are unknown.

The Crown demands her swift return and promises great rewards to those who fulfill the mission.

**LONG GAMEPLAY GUIDE**

**PARTY PHASE**
Reveal your characters
Each character answers: Who is Safira for you? Why did she escape? What do you think she wants to do? 

**ADVENTURE PHASE:**

1.  **Place four encounter cards in a row:** ➤ This is your turn.
2.  **The 1st player reveals the first card (left or right):** ➤ This player is the DM for this encounter!
3.  **The DM narrates the encounter:** ➤ Unleash your DM imagination!
4.  **DM rolls DC for this encounter (DM):** ➤ DM roll 1d20 to set the EDC (Encounter Dice Check).
5.  **Set EDC Range:** ➤ The Encounter Dice Check Range formula: \[DM roll-1, DM roll, DM roll+1].
    *   Example: DM rolls 14. EDC: 13, 14, 15.
    *   Example 2: DM rolls 20. EDC: 19, 20, 21.
6.  **After the EDC is determined, the next player narrates how their character interacts with this encounter:** ➤ Unleash your player imagination! Once narration is finished, that player immediately rolls their 1d20 dice to see if their character resolves (bests, or wins) the encounter ➤ Player roll 1d20.
7.  **Check Bonuses:** ➤ Apply your ability modifiers or your encounter bonuses.
    *   If any of the abilities on the character card match an ability on the encounter card, that character can manipulate the result of their roll by 1 (either adding or subtracting 1 from their rolled value).
    *   If you have won an encounter card in a previous turn, you may use (exhaust, consume) the effect on that encounter card to adjust your roll value. If you do it, exhaust this encounter card (flip it face down).
8.  **Resolve the encounter:** ➤ If the character manages to resolve the EDC, that character has won the encounter. If no character in the party manages to resolve the EDC, Safira receives that card (move the card to her Hideout).
9.  Repeat steps 6-8 with all other players except the DM. Then, finally, the player that was the DM for this encounter plays the encounter as their character (by repeating steps 6 and 7 as all other players).
10. **In case of TIE:** (i.e., two or more characters have also managed to resolve the EDC), those players need to roll again simultaneously, and whoever receives a greater number wins.
    
**SAFIRA'S PHASE:**

Setup: 
Shuffle Safira's encounter cards (encounters Safira won through the game). 
Arrange them face up in rows of four, from left to right. This usually creates columns of varying heights.

Challenge Order: 
Safira's encounters are challenged from right to left, column by column. There can be up to four columns.

Resolution order:
Each column is treated as a single, combined encounter.
The DM opens all cards in a column, narrates the story connecting these encounters and rolls a single d20 to determine the Encounter Difficulty Check (EDC) for this entire column 
(i.e. all encounters in that column will now have the same EDC)

Players will now attempt to resolve individual cards within the current column using the standard game mechanics

A)The next player in turn order chooses what encounter will they engage 
B) Narrates their actions
C) Rolls 1d20, applies bonuses, and checks against the EDC range.
        (As usual other players may assist with their bonuses)
D)If the encounter is resolved it is fliced face down, if it is not, it remains face up. 
E)The next player engages an encounter in that same column until
